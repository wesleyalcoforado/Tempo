Tempo is a simple Chrome extension that checks the current weather from Yahoo APIs.
It tries to guess the user location from the browser's geolocation capabilities, but it also allows the user to type the city he wants.

(Tempo is available at Chrome Web Store)[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bfphkhbbhgofbilnbbkoecgljoiklcoj]
